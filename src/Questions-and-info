Problem 1: Find Maximum in Array
Write a Java program to find the maximum value in an array of integers.

Problem 2: Palindrome Check
Objective
Write a Java program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case differences.

Steps to Implement Palindrome Check
Input the string: Take a string as input from the user.
Normalize the string: Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert it to lower case.
Check for palindrome:
Compare characters from the beginning and end of the string moving towards the center.
If all corresponding characters match, the string is a palindrome.
Output the result: Print whether the string is a palindrome or not.

Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

Requirements:

Use classes to model the calculator.
Use control flow statements to handle invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).

4- Print first 50 odd numbers
5 Print first 50 even numbers
6 Add the first 50 even numbers and print the sum
7 Add the first 50 odd numbers and print the sum
8 Calculate the factorial of number n (1 >> n <= 12)
9 Print the first n number in the fibonacci series ( 1 >> n << 100)
10 Reverse a string without using the inbuilt functions provided by the language
11 Check if the given string is palindrome or not
12 Read a given string and count how many times a given alphabet or number is repeated
13 Find first duplicate in an array of numbers
14 Sum all the numbers in array
15 Sum only the Odd or Even Numbers in array

16. Add two numbers without directly adding them
17. Subtract two numbers without directly subtracting it
18. Given an input numbers list down all the possible factor's for it
